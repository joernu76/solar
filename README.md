# SOLAR

This package of python utilities is designed to compute the ideal output of 
rooftop PV, primarily for my own use. It reads in the CSV files generated by
by SMA Sunny Explorer and relates these to ideal output for diagnostic reasons.

The model fits my data on most days, but does not take into account the 
degeneration due to overheating of the inverter in summer. This causes a systematic
overestimation of generated solar power. The effect could be simply added if
inverter temperature were supplied or modelled depending on the generated power
and environmental conditions.

# First steps

The compare.py script analyses the potential yearly output for rooftop solar
depending on azimuth and elevation of the installation as example.

The solar.py module hard codes the PV setup. The global variables need to
be changed or adapted before running the methods contained.
